## Predicting the effect of gender on dynamic capability drivers and sustainable performance using machine learning. 
# The analysis encompasses the classification algorithms to predict the role of gender.  
#  The study starts with the principal components analysis to prepare the ground for machine learning methods.
# Of course, the essence behind using the principal components is to check the existence of outliers in a data set before downstream analysis.
# Thus, the analysis set out the empirical evaluation by training and testing using various ensemble classifier algorithm. 
#Following the explanation above, the analysis has made the empirical evaluation through; 
1. CART MODEL
2. Random Forest
3. C.50 Tree
4. Stochastic Gradient Boosting 
5. Xgboost
#To this end, the XGBoost shows significant predictions compared to other classifiers. It suggests that the XGboost is solid for building the predictive model since it builds robust fitted models.
